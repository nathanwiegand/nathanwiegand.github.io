[The Man from the Future](https://a.co/d/758o9l9)

John von Neumann was a genius among geniuses. 
> Von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us. - Edward Teller

He either invented or was a major contributor to:
- quantum mechanics: introduced the concept of a Hilbert space in quantum mechanics.
- game theory: Co-founded the field of game theory with his 1944 book, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern.
- computer design: Pioneered the architecture of the modern digital computer (von Neumann architecture)
- economics: Worked on economic theory, including the development of linear programming.
- automata theory: Developed the theory of self-replicating machines (cellular automata), which influenced later developments in computer science and artificial life.
